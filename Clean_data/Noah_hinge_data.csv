What would this girl like to do!
Sorry forgot she told me I am not allowed to mention that
My therapist would say that’s gaslighting
No that’s not allowed she’s got to decide
Food and drinks sounds good
?
Any other day
Don’t you dare disrespect Gabe like that he’s a legend
Know anyone who would be interested??
Ok np
But I don’t think he knows what he’s talking about
Oh my god that’s what my ex would say to me !!
Ah that’s too bad we don’t like normal
Sounds good
When?
Tuesday?
Hm I didn’t consider that though I’m not sure why anyone would lie to their therapist
I’ll be at supermarket tonight:)
It’s ok I’m not that much better

Kk ms bronze lux
Add me chaddycheeseys
But I can get you out of bronze

Ya but concordia is a big school so it’s not too bad
I also use a lot of the Adobe suite
Oh cool what types of software do you use
Oh cool what type of stuff do you do
Unfortunately it’s summer
Nice I’ve skated a lot too but I mainly snowboard
Yea it’s a lot of fun I would love to teach you in an instructor
I’m in computational arts
"So lots of film, photo, video games, websites type of stuff"
Yea it very small only 60 people it’s why I went to concordia
Did you just call my mom a man
Ohhh do u skate a lot
He’s obviously not that smart 😂
What do you take at TMU?
So it’s like all forms of digital art + programming
Ik this is too soon but I think I’m in love
What’d u do?
And you cook for your family?
Wait sorry I’m an idiot
Long day of laying around
Pause
Nothing was going through my head
Hydrangea?
My good friend works at the other one farther east
I’m going to supermarket tonight
Ok i will let her know
Lots of people from rosedale go
I recently took a shot with ms maletin lol
Soooo when do I get to meet you?
Idk if you remember me
Ms maletin made out with her boy toy on the patio
I was working at a VFX company but got fired two weeks ago cause of the writers strike
Where do you go now
I’ve been applying but I don’t wanna go back to service so it’s been tough
It’s a loaded program but I love it
That’s was suppose to be the line 😭
So like
No I didn’t
Design + digital arts + computer science
I’m still unemployed 🫡
😅
Ur kidding I’d love to be paid to eat ice cream all day
She’s been married for like 40 years tho so good luck
Yes I miss it so much
#2 have fun
Which is good means I’m very free to hangout
What r u taking at Tmu
But business boo
Mr
For 1 while shift
Nope it was like a test shift didn’t get my smart serve within two days
Funny enough she’s my roomate.
He definitely does
Damn I thought you looked kinda familiar
I pretty much ran rosedale 😎
That’s about it
It was pretty fun Tuesday is open mic night so people go up and sing
I love ms maletin she was my homie
#1 get a job
Sounds similar to my program then
Hahaha
At this bar I used to work at they came in
Any summer plans for you?
I’m quite the ice cream connoisseur tho so it depends where I go
Wait did you go to rosedale?
I briefly worked at dolce gelato
Oh nice where were you
Oh nice
Do you know zjolie?
Ms maletin was kinda a milf
Do you work at Ed’s?
And me light
It was an interesting night
Mango gelato
I think you’d have a better chance with her if you go out for drinks with her son tho
I go for computational arts
No where
Mostly design and film
I just know there’s an Ed’s in Leslieville
Yea print making on the other hand was horrible
Oh nice my friend prolly knows him
If ice cream then like a cookie dough
If u took media in grade 10 I was probably your peer tutor
You work anywhere?
Ecogastronomy?
Was I wrong?
Computer science ?
Hmmmm architecture?
Stalking me?
Oh right what a nice friend he is
It was a week tmrw
Woah don’t come for me
Are you going to supermarket Tn
It’s been a week
R u performing in London
Yay I wanna come to a show I went to Natasha’s band last week and it was really good
What why was it memorable
We’ll listen I have seen in your tour dates that you don’t come to Montreal
I’m just trying to have my hot boy summer
True my family has been gone all weekend so it’s just me
Oh nice wine?
I’m getting drunk with my friends
I’m not a beer guy so that might be a problem
Ik it’s deathly
Which drinks?
Even my dog is gone 😢
I’m drinking this gin fizz thing it’s really good
Gin smashes and coronas
But I wouldn’t mind getting drunk with your family
That’s my guess
Ew bud lights r kinda gross
But I love my vodka crans
It was pretty fun I went up to Kingston for a night
What’s up
Tequila 💯
Yes pink can
Just the best shot
Other then that it’s been a lot of partying
Fair enough
I like my seltzers too
BC?
Alberta?
It’s harder to pick up but easier to master
I was good in highschool but horrible in university
You must study really hard
I’m an instructor I can teach you
I’m terrible at math vectors and matrices were not it
I mean average sizes
But I’ve had fun ones too
True I went to private school for middle school it was horrible
Hahaha

So it’s like computer science + digital arts
Met a girl on tinder and it was just a horrible experience

Hbu
Where’d u go to highschool
Yes all my life
Where skiing is the opposite
But I went to rosedale which was much better
Technically yes but my program is an arts program so I don’t have to do the maths
Do you ski in Ontario ?
Yea it the best closest option
I get free trips too cause I run it
I grew up in riverdale
Meh nothing really out of the ordinary
But now I run the concordia ski and snowboard club and we go all over Quebec which is much nicer
Holy shit

Concordia has the full week off so I’m there till next Saturday
Hm how about Monday then?
What type of art r u into
Yes I have a ton met a bunch of them too they r some of my closest friends
Wbu
Oh nice we’re super close
😂😂
I mean i think thanksgiving a pretty overrated holiday too honestly plus it’s ties to colonialism is not a good look
Sorry I got confused lol
Are the stars aligned now then?
So anything you can do on a computer that could be considered art
Cool de la salle is nice
But I’m from Riverdale
Where’d u go to highschool
No I’m not I’m still in Montreal I leave Sunday
Still down for tmrw?
Not really just like us and my grandmother
Online friends r some of the best
Why have i never seen you then ?
The worst is when someone’s claims they’re from Toronto but they’re from like Oakville
Omg i feel so special
Pumpkin muffins sounds a bit more like Halloween 🤔
Oh nice is your friend visiting?
Ohh sick what platform did you guys meet on
Yea I’m down
Ohhhh i thought ur friend was visiting you in Toronto
Post modernism 🥴
Is a full pumpkin pie too high of a dose?
Ik I honestly rather stay in Montreal but my parents want me back
Thank you I just started last year
It’s like a mix of all digital arts
Ohh model UN
What are you doing this week
I have an Instagram account it’s noahkedits it has some of my like mini projects
It gives post modernism and net art
Or wait are you in Montreal now?
When do you go back to Montreal?
I mean Markham is not Toronto but I think u can count Etobicoke
Yea friendsgiving is always fun
Twitter 🚩🚩🚩
Yea I actually do a lot of video editting I was working at a VFX company for a bit
What about next Sunday?
I’m like if your girlfriend was a boy so it works out pretty well
I have never been to the planetarium
Are you vegetarian?
I’m in computational arts
I get back on Saturday
London England? 😫
Wbu
3D modelling I also love
Oh nice i have to go back to Toronto 😞
Lmk what they say
I meant like a medium or smth like if ur into drawing or painting
Turkey is highly overrated honestly
I have no plans
Your designs r cooler I really like them
Oh to be fair Etobicoke is part of Toronto
You right the only interesting thing about me is I snowboard
It’s my whole personality
I’d be down but it’ll cost you a date
Yea it’s definitely a commitment for the first few days
Are you part of the mcgill ski club?
Well I’m also a digital artist but that’s not nearly as interesting as snowboarding
Good you should go on the concordia trips they r better
I am an instructor
Do you ski?
Just have to follow the Instagram and buy a ticket for the trips
It’s hard to pick up but easy to master
Is that all I am to you? A snowboard instructor?
Snowboarding is cooler
Sorry to disappoint but sometimes I skateboard too 😎
I’m an expensive instructor
I like Tom holland I think he’s the closest to Spider-Man
What bar?
Awesome I got a ticket
How about at 4pm
Well I wouldn’t say I’m on the professional level but I’ve been working in premier for like 6 years and after effects for around 2-3
I ended up like building scripts to improve the teams workflow so I would cut their hours in half
Lots of coding + design + digital arts
But Andrew is also great
I mostly did like file organization and wrote a lot of code for their like pipeline which was a little more rewarding then organizing files
What we’re u doing on set?
"I also work a lot in touchdesigner premier, blender"
🥴
I’m trying to think of something related to editing but isn’t just watching a movie
There’s also a space exhibition at PHI that looks cool
"I think the sex desire technology like the coolest, as well as the space exhibition."
You can check out some of my personal projects on @noahkedits. Though I don’t think there’s a lot of after effects projects on it just one or two
"Nice, yea lowkey the pay is ass and the people kinda suck"
I’m quite the nerd
I study computational arts so kinda? It’s like all forms of digital arts but they don’t have a lot of film editing unfortunately
Are you in school?
There’s also “new media pioneers” which is a collection of like vr multimedia works
I’m a sucker for a lil bit of nerd
Yea I absolutely love my program
We can go to PHI or MAC
Don’t overthink it
Are you into marvel or just Spider-Man?
As an intern your really not allowed to touch anything
Fair enough
What are you up to this week?
Haha classic
?
Oh nice in what way
I was working at a VFX company for a bit in DaVinci resolve
So what do u get up to when ur not editting
"So the PHI Center has a sex, desire and technology exhibition that looks pretty cool, or the MAC has a pussy riot exhibition"
Lol
Honestly after working as a jr editor I was like this shit mad boring lol
Still on for Sunday?
Inside
Yea I totally agree
Oh nice
K sick any time work better for you!
Ok so we’ll each buy a ticket for 4pm?
I also work in service for like 5 years 🫡
Let’s do the sex desire and technology if your down it’s a lot cheaper
I’m pretty advanced in after effects and motion design
Wdym overthink
And I swear it’s just because he’s hot
So I was actually pretty useful but I got layed off cause of the writers strike
Ok how about you pick a time
Also wanted to be an editor since I was a kid
It’s a toxic industry
Did you buy a ticket?
Ohh like video editting?
Sunday works
Ok that is what everyone says
That’s awesome! Very rarely do I meet someone who has the same hobbies
We’ll Id love to meet you
Wdym overthink
No way
Nice where did you graduate from
Any preference on what we do?  I
But it’s still cool to see some movies before the effects
When do you get off
Yep!
Definitely all the movies but I used it read the comics and everything
Any day but Friday and Saturday at night
https://billetterie.phi.ca/main/sexe-desirs-et-data-novembre

I love my new balances
My mom is a producer for cbc
But I feel like that was the point no?
Did that make ur sex therapy self cry
I think they also just wanted to like end the show so
😮
I was a big marvel fan
But like psychological thrillers will scare the shit out of me and keep me up at night
I agree
So I can watch like 1 a month

He lives close to me
Finished

In general
But tell your friend to atleast let me keep some of my masculinity
But I’ve def met a lot of people in psych
Yes it’s ok
Boo Quebec skiing isn’t as good as BC but it’s alright
They r not considered running shoes

It’s like there’s actually nothing behind you
No worries

He decided against it
Pigeons
We can have a philosophical debate?

Because of my program
Not too often prolly twice or three times a year just over the breaks and for summer usually
Wait let’s do Saturday
Friday?
Great I know the perfect spruce tree in McGill?
So like 15 minutes?
How utterly romantic
What about Tuesday ?
In a life or death situation how fast could you climb up a spruce tree
We can do it and I’ll time you
What’s your top tier delusion
That’s funny because the world actually revolves around me and things only exist when I’m looking at them
😳
But your probably just saying that too make me believe in the simulation
Suicide
Sounds good
So your probably not real
Sorry
Only one way to find out
I was worried for a second
Or we can go out for dinner
Tuesday night?
What’s your first request
School
But I actually love in Montreal and it’s 100% better

None of that kale garbage
Very cool your still pretty close to Toronto

Berries and banana
Hi Kat

I’m from Toronto nothing crazy but I love and go to school in Montreal
Stereo and unity are good but can be expensive covers
I can give you more recommendations but it’d have to be over drinks
Ever been to a Montreal rave?
Then I would say stay away from apt 200
But they run after hours
How can you be so sure
He’s a tough critic
Hi intrigued I’m noah

New York has “flagels”
Ohhh that’s not good

Mac demarco ?
Valid sorry I’m oblivious
I only listen to real manly music like the backseat lovers 💪
Ok computer or in rainbows ?
In rainbows is the best album (not that I’m an avid Radiohead listener 🙄)
Radio head doesn’t scream make manipulator to me like mac demarco does
Well i have to meet you first yk

Unfortunately he’s in Toronto
What’s your schedule looking like

Oh good
What are you up to tonight?
You’ve seen Star Wars ??
They’re so garbage
Lots of fun I love it
Where are you from?
Unfortunately I don’t smoke anymore
Do you like it?
You know what goes really well with pitchers of sangria?
I study computational arts
But if you’ve had enough to drink they’re a lot of fun
A pitcher of each that’s how you do it
I’m not sure how to answer that question
That’s why I’m saying sangria 💪
Are you a skier then?
My deal is a pitcher of sangria and a comedy show with you
You’re joking
What about order a pitcher of sangria instead
How fancy
It’s like art + computer science
A really shit comedy show
Hbu
Like Vancouver Vancouver?
🤞🤞
Jewish by religion or Jewish by culture
Same 😎
I’m already obsessed
I’m more of a in your walls type of person
He’s a shepoo and a poodle

The first one is him but he kinda looks like a blanket
I have a lot of friends with dogs here too
Yea but he’s in Toronto 😢
Shitzu and a poodle
Fuck no
How about you give me your Instagram and then you can show me
There two pictures of him on my profile

The first one is him but he kinda looks like a blanket
Thank you I feel special
I SWEAR I DONT HAVE AN ARCTERYX BEANIE I SWEAR
Ok do you good I just wanted to make that clear
And what have you burned down?
You really think so?
So what r u up to this week Isabelle?
I completely agree

Since nothing matters anyway we should probably go out
Great now that that is settled
I’m not a bug but I think I’m pretty cool😎
What are you taking at concordia?
"Awesome, ready for pick up"
Do you do as well?
Do you do art as well***
But I have watch every movie in order a number of times
What about you

I’ll have you know I can grow a pretty good moustache
I’m just like ur average marvel fan
Well I am quite a nerd aswell
Yes omg the recent movies have been terrible
Which Spider-Man is your favourite then?
Now that sounds like a deal
Umm i dont think so pretty sure you stole it from me
Up to you
Yea like fist fight
Looks like we have to commit arson now
Or have drinks
I was going to say we should duke it out but that’s works too
Let me guess
Virgo
I definitely did not have to search up how to spell that
My star sign aligns with adhd
Yes
💪
Pisces
"Scorpio and Pisces make an excellent couple. They share a creative, emotional view on life and have a lot of insight into each other's emotions and brains. Scorpio is devoted to everything they accomplish, and they enjoy including Pisces in their goals."
I’ve tried the whole trifecta of vvyvanse adderall and conserta
I have no idea what any star sign means
Pisces
It doesn’t say on your profile
Nah I just made that up
No
🤧
It means your sincere and compassionate but irritable
Theoretically
🐟
My moms vvyvanse
But sounded right?
Oh sorry we’re incompatible🙄
Yes
Knock me out with cyanide then drown me
Fuck that I just want you for your clothes
Me
I’m just spit balling here
👉👈
Give me a hint
Pour gasoline over me then light a cigarette
🥺
Hey hey I don’t give sexual favours for anything besides money
Which god is the question?
Let’s get married
Nooo im leaving at the end of the week
Maybe we should go explore them… say tomorrow?
I bet our kids would love that
You can’t call off the wedding it’s too late

I’d be very sad
I already invested so much into our wedding
What about the Toronto sewage system
But u can choose the date
It is
:(

For a few weeks till the end of the semester
Well what do we do now Quinn

Messages from the stars

Through Aiden ??
We have
I’m always delusional
You have to make sure your worthy
The dance comes out on the 3rd date
Probably tease you
Glad we came to a conclusion
Lions can’t do that
Ok but like what about arceus
And that I won
There’s a lot of Pokémon…
Well how much do you know about lions
It’s how I show affection
Some Pokémon have imposable thumbs they can hold guns and shit
I wholeheartedly agree Toronto sucks
Thought you were in Montreal Kat
Rather be in Montreal
That’s fun
Oh that’s super fun
Same here
Are you working in Toronto?
I got boiler room next weekend

That can be arranged
Perfect

I love cart I don’t think there’s another program more perfect for me
Yea nice I was just with him yesterday

Haha Molly will have that effect
And some
Great sounds like we’ll have an awkward first date
Ssri queen
You know octopuses are really anti social but when they are given Molly they become social and even hug each other
What are u then
What about I go in for like a handshake and you go in for a fist bump
Maybe a little bit
Maybe if I drove us into a ditch after?
You don’t seem that interested
I have an electric skateboard
But we could have a league themed wedding
Anything else I have to do to get you to marry me?
I could take you for a whip
What if we got married?
Especially in Montreal
But a motorcycle doesnt?
I love ice cream but if your gift is ice cream I think that’s a whole different issue
Like literally any other flavo
I’m sorry I don’t like chocolate Ice cream
Flavour
Favourite tiny desk concert go
Not as real as eating a piece of Lego
"Oh cool he does some pretty similar stuff he’s in computational arts, which is pretty much coms + film + programming"
What are you favourite parts of coms / what do you work in
My moms son thinks your really cute
My moms son says he appreciates it and asks how your day was and what you study
So I guess he ones up you
I think you’re probably the love of my life

Yasmine!
Skiing is for losers anyway
I’ll help you
We can try again
Hmm I guess I could look past that
It’s ok I’m an instructor
Ramen is so much better
You get the full flavour profile
Doesn’t sound like I’ve convinced you
This is so not true
I’m here to find out
Are you saying I have to fight your evil exs to win your heart?
Wait are you saying someone else manages your account??
Damn got a full hierarchy of command
Do you get paid?
Do I fit the bill ?
Do I get to find out who the account manager is now?
So why manage the account is she shy?
Like just straight milk?
Nono I love cheese i just don’t drink milk like raw
Omg r u doing this without her knowing
I don’t drink milk
Sorry I generally don’t see a lot of people having their accounts managed?
Well is the account manager single and doesn’t drink a lot of milk?
Nkornberg

Respectable opinion

"Freya i used to breakdance, can solve a rubix cube, and crochet"
Almost there
The first time I saw you I thought you were from Ireland cause my penis is Dublin in size
